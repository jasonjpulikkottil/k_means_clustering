# K means clustering
<p>* implement k-means algorithm from scratch (without any external libraries).</p>
<p>* Is feature scaling required for the K-means Algorithm? Explain why or why not.</p>
<p>* How are centriods use in K-means? What are some alterenatives that you could use?</p>

<p>* What are the challenges associated with K-means clustering? State at least 3.</p>
<p>* How to decide the optimal number of K in the K means Algorithm? Describe at least 2 methods.</p>

<p>* How to perform K means on larger datasets to make it faster?</p>
<p>* Perform statistical analysis on the dataset(check the distribution for both numerical and categorcial columns(pairplots or any other plots) and correlation among the numerical features).</p>
<p>* Find the optimal K value and show a plot that it is optimal. Decribe what you did and why.</p>
